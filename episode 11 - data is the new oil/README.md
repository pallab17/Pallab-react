1. Higher order components
![hoc](image-4.png)

So basically higher order component is a function which takes A component as an input and. it enhances that component and provides that enhanced component as output
In this project I'm going to use the promoted tag that has been provided to the restaurant cards, as we can see in the swiggy website. So as we face. the data from Swiggy, there is an option as promoted which is providing us Boolean value. So according to that Boolean value, we will create a label tag and in that label tag we will write promoted for the cards which is promoted. Now we will create a higher order component in the restaurant. cards page such that that component higher order component will take the restoring card as the input it will enhance it and the enhancing is like it will just add a level on top and then it will again provide us the restaurant card and and and this enhance component is the output that we will use in the body component. whenever the any restaurant is giving us the Boolean value of promoted. So basically if I sum it up higher order function is nothing but of higher order component is nothing but a function which takes input t in the form of a component and provides output with that component with some enhance or extra features.

we can use this to make our appn better

now we are trying create a feature  that jokhun amara ekta accordian khulbo
baki accordian gulo collapse/bondho hoye jabe
eta tough as sob kota alada category r nijesso state ache

recommonded category r itemlist r control recommonded r kache ache
serom ei newly launced category r itemlist r control newly r kachei ache
ebar newly jane o na recommnded r state r bepare aar khule naki collapse hoye ache kichui janena
eibar amra chaichi je bhai recommonded khulle baki category guno jeno collapsee hoye jaaye
tarmane we want this state to be lifted up
so i dont want je recommonded category r power jeno recommonded r kache thake
power ta ami recommonded r baap ke dite chai 
baap bolbe showitems korbe kina

restaurant menu baap restaurant category r
so restaurant menu bolbe show korte jokhun ei tokhun ei restaurant category show korbe 
noile korbe na

so restaurant category r nijesso state thakbe na

controlled component = no nijesso state, baap control korche baccha ke 
![controlled component r example](image-9.png)


uncontrolled component =  nijesso state +  baap control korche na baccha ke
